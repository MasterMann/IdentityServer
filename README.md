## About IdentityServer

IdentityServer is a free, open source [OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/connect/) and [OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) framework for ASP.NET Core.
Founded and maintained by [Dominick Baier](https://twitter.com/leastprivilege) and [Brock Allen](https://twitter.com/brocklallen), IdentityServer incorporates all the protocol implementations and extensibility points needed to integrate token-based authentication, single-sign-on and API access control in your applications.
